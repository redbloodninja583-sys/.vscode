    <h1>Saiyan Saga!</h1>
    
    
    <p>
The Saiyan Saga begins with the shocking arrival of Raditz, who reveals that Goku is actually an alien warrior named Kakarot and that two much stronger Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, are coming to Earth.

Goku is forced to team up with his enemy, Piccolo, a temporary alliance that results in both of them being killed to defeat Raditz. The surviving Z Fighters spend a year training while Goku traverses Snake Way to train with King Kai.

The villains arrive, and Nappa brutally kills several heroes, including Piccolo, until Goku finally returns with the Kaio-ken technique.

The saga climaxes in a legendary, destructive battle between Goku and Vegeta, who pushes the fight to his Great Ape transformation.

Ultimately, the Saiyan Prince is defeated only through the combined efforts of Goku's friends and the Spirit Bomb, and he retreats to space, vowing revenge.</p>
